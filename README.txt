All agents run with the same random seed. Thus the food respawns at the same locations for each agent istance.

Run the following command to launch all agents:
-> python launch.py

Run the following command with arguments to run specific agent:
-> python main.py <A*/GBFS/UCS> <COLOR> <MAZE.TXT> <WINDOW TITLE>

Example:
--> python main.py A* green Maps/hurdlesMaze.txt "A* Implementation"
